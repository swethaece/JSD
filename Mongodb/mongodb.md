MongoDB
=======

*It is an open source, document oriented (paragraph format)
*It is a database that stores data in the form of documents (Key value pairs)

Document based example
=====================

var stud = {
    Rno : 1001,
    name : "Abi",
    age : "21",
    website : "www.abi.com",
    hobbies : ["video editing", "drawing"]
}

Nested Json
===========

var emp : {
    eno : 1,
    ename : "Abi",
    esal : 28000.50,
    designtion : "trainer",
    qualification : "MCA",
    Preemplocation : { city1 : "trichy",
    city2 : "Karur" }
}

This is a json like structure where data is stored in the form of key value pairs.

History of MongoDB
==================

*It was created by Eliot and Dwight in 2007,due to they faced scalability issues while working with relational database.

*The organization that developed MongoDB was originally known as 10gen.

*In Feb 2009, they changed their business model and released MongoDB as an open source project.

*The organization changed its name in 2013 and now known as MongoDB Inc.

Features of MongoDB
MongoDB provides high performance:
Most of the operations in MongoDB are faster
MongoDB provides auto replication feature
that allows you to quickly recover data in case of a failure.
Horizontal scaling is possible in MongoDB because of sharing
Sharding is partitioning of data and placing it on multiple machines in such a way that the order of the data is preserved.
How to create database

use databasename Ex: use jsd

How to insert sample data?

jsd >db.collectionname.insertOne({})

Ex:

nmvnjsd > db.student.insertOne({ rno : 1001,sname : "Abinaya",mark : 98})

Insert 10 records

How to view data from collections?

nmvnjsd > db.student.find()

how to view all databases?

show dbs

how to view all collections from a db?

show collections

how to change from one db to another db?
