*Node.js is a single-threaded application, 
but it can support concurrency via the concept of event and callbacks.

*Every API of Node.js is asynchronous and being single-threaded, 
they use async function calls to maintain concurrency.

*Node thread keeps an event loop and whenever a task gets completed, 
it fires the corresponding event which signals the event-listener function 
to execute.

*callback functions are called when an asynchronous function returns its result
Node.js has multiple in-built events available through events module and 
EventEmitter class which are used to bind events and event-listeners

*{!important notes: EventEmitter provides multiple properties like on and emit. 
on property is used to bind a function with the event and
emit is used to fire an event.}


note:
=====
*emit-------> fire event(calling function)
		like client
		one or more request send to on properties

*on---------->bind event( called function)
		like server
		only one 
		purpose: send response to client(emit)

how to install event?
=====================

goto terminal
set your project folder
d:/project folder>npm install events

-----------------------------------------------
// Import events module
var events = require('events');

// Create an eventEmitter object
var eventEmitter = new events.EventEmitter();

Following is the syntax to bind an event handler with an event −
// Bind event and event handler as follows
eventEmitter.on('eventName', eventHandler);

We can fire an event programmatically as follows −
// Fire an event
eventEmitter.emit('eventName');
--------------------------------------------------
example
// Import events module
var events = require('events');

// Create an eventEmitter object
var eventEmitter = new events.EventEmitter();

// Create an event handler as follows
var connectHandler = function connected() {
   console.log('connection succesful.');
  
   // Fire the data_received event 
   eventEmitter.emit('data_received');
}

// Bind the connection event with the handler
eventEmitter.on('connection', connectHandler);
 
// Bind the data_received event with the anonymous function
eventEmitter.on('data_received', function() {
   console.log('data received succesfully.');
});

// Fire the connection event 
eventEmitter.emit('connection');

console.log("Program Ended.");
